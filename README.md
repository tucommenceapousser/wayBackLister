## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What It Does

WaybackLister is a reconnaissance tool that taps into the Wayback Machine to fetch historical URLs for a domain, parses unique paths, and checks if any of those paths currently expose **directory listings**. It's fast, multithreaded, and built for practical use in security assessments and bug bounty recon.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Pulls archived URLs via the Wayback Machine
- Extracts unique paths and subdomains from those URLs
- Actively checks for live directory listings
- Supports multithreaded scanning
- Can auto-discover subdomains based on Wayback data
- Works with single domain or list of domains

---

## üì¶ Installation

Clone the repo and you're good to go:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anmolksachan/wayBackLister.git
cd wayBackLister
pip install -r requirements.txt -> To be updated
```

## üß† Why This Tool?

Sometimes, old URLs archived by the Wayback Machine lead to interesting places‚Äîespecially when they still work. Directory listings can reveal sensitive files, backups, or even forgotten admin panels. WaybackLister helps you find them in a systematic and scriptable way.
